\- At that moment, you will unplug your grandma's life support if that's the only socket left.

\- Parents' voice notes: 5-minute recordings just to say, 'Call me.'   
\- Video calls: Why do parents always hold the camera under their chin?   
\- I've seen my dad's nose hairs more than I've seen my best friend's face. 

# **Social Media vs. Real Life:**

# **School Life:**

\- Group projects: One person works, one disappears, one brings snacksI was the snack guy.   
\- Exams: 'Bro, I'm gonna fail.' Results: 95%. Bro, pick a struggle.   
\- School bags were so heavy; I think I carried my future in there. 

# **Wi-Fi Struggles:**

\- Visiting relatives: 'Hi, hello, namaste what's your Wi-Fi password?'   
\- Wi-Fi dead spots: One step to the leftsignal gone, welcome to the Bermuda Triangle.   
\- Callback: 'I've entered the nostril zone\!' (referring to dad's video calls) 

# **Closing:**
